# Copilot / AI agent instructions — Replica Factor Calculator

Summary
- Repo state: at the time of analysis this workspace contains only the `.git/` directory; no source files or top-level README were found. Agents should treat this as a thin repository and begin by locating project sources (branches, other clones, or submodules).

Primary goals for automated agents
- Discover where the project code and tests live (likely `src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, or language-specific folders).
- Identify build and test commands from files like `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, or CI configs.
- Avoid speculative changes; if the repository appears empty, open an issue or prompt a human for missing artifacts.

Actionable steps (first-run checklist)
- Run these commands locally (PowerShell):
  - `git status --porcelain` — check working tree cleanliness.
  - `git ls-files` — list tracked files; if empty, repository has no committed sources.
  - `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Force -File` — search working directory for hidden files.
- If `README.md`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, or `.github/workflows/*` exist, open them to extract build/test commands.
- If no source files exist in the repo, do NOT create significant new project scaffolding without confirmation; instead, report back with the discovery and suggested next steps.

Project-specific hints discovered
- Current repository snapshot contained only `.git/`. There were no code files to analyze for language, frameworks, or test tooling.

How to proceed when sources are found
- Extract language/tooling indicators and top commands:
  - Node: `package.json` → `npm run build`, `npm test`.
  - Python: `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` → `python -m pytest` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - .NET: look for `.sln` or `*.csproj`.
- Search for CI files under `.github/workflows/` and mirror their steps locally for build/test commands.

Conventions and patterns to respect
- Prefer minimal, targeted edits: only change or add files that solve a small, reviewable task.
- If creating new files, include a short rationale in the commit message and link to the user issue or prompt that requested the change.

Integration/Dependency notes
- No external integration points (APIs, databases, cloud infra) were discovered in this snapshot. If/when such configs appear (e.g., `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `terraform/`), surface them in a follow-up report and do not assume credentials are present.

Examples to look for in this repo (when present)
- `src/` or `lib/` — primary source files.
- `tests/` or `spec/` — unit/integration tests; run these with the project's chosen test runner.
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` — containerized workflows; prefer the documented `docker` commands.

When to ask for human help
- If the repo is empty or missing expected artifacts for the user's described project, ask the repo owner to provide:
  - A brief README describing intended language/tooling and the primary entry point.
  - Any CI/workflow YAML or build scripts used historically.

If you (agent) made changes
- Add a concise commit message describing the change and include a link to this instructions file.

Contact
- If uncertain about project goals or acceptable scope, comment on the issue or PR requesting clarification before making large changes.
